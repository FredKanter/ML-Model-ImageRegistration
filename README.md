# Meta-Learning-Model-for-Image-Registration
Code published in context of MIDL 2022

## Toolbox
This is a minimal version of our unFAIR toolbox which is intended to close the gap between conventional gradient-based
 optimization methods and neural networks in the context of image registration. It is a python and pytorch based
 framework in development.
 
## Requirements
In order to use our toolbox, you need python 3.5 or newer.
The following packages are needed (we make use of a docker enviroment. The package versions are indicated in the
brackets):
    - pytorch       (1.3.1)
    - pillow        (9.4.0)
    - dill          (0.2.9)
    - h5py          (2.9.0)
    - numpy         (1.16.3)
    - pandas        (0.24.2)
    - torchvision   (0.4.2)
    - scipy         (1.2.1)
    - matplotlib    (3.2.1)
